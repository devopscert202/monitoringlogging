# ELK Stack Training for DevOps Engineers

---

## **1. Introduction to Centralized Logging & Monitoring**

Centralized logging enables DevOps engineers to collect, manage, and analyze logs from multiple sources in one place, making it easier to troubleshoot issues, monitor performance, and ensure system reliability.

### **Why Centralized Logging Matters**

* Simplifies monitoring across distributed systems.
* Reduces time to identify and resolve issues.
* Supports compliance and security audits.
* Enables advanced analytics and visualization.

## **2. ELK Stack Overview**

The **ELK Stack** is an open-source logging and monitoring suite comprising three major components:

| **Component**             | **Role**                                 | **Key Features**                                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Elasticsearch**         | Log storage, search, and analysis engine | Distributed architecture, real-time indexing, advanced search |
| **Logstash**              | Log ingestion and processing pipeline    | Collects, parses, filters, and transforms data                |
| **Kibana**                | Visualization and monitoring interface   | Dashboards, alerts, real-time log exploration                 |
| **Filebeat** *(optional)* | Lightweight log shipper                  | Sends logs from endpoints to Logstash or Elasticsearch        |

---

## **3. Types of Logs & Their Role in ELK**

| **Log Type**         | **Description**                  | **Use Cases**               | **Impact on ELK**                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Structured Logs      | Predefined format (JSON, XML)    | API calls, database queries | Easy indexing & search                |
| Unstructured Logs    | Free-text logs without structure | Application errors          | Requires parsing (e.g., Grok filters) |
| Semi-Structured Logs | Mix of structured + unstructured | Web server logs             | Needs partial parsing                 |

---

## **4. Centralized vs Distributed Logging**

| **Aspect**         | **Centralized Logging**                   | **Distributed Logging**                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Aggregates logs into a single platform    | Logs stored across multiple locations   |
| **Benefits**       | Simplified management, unified dashboards | Better scalability, reduced SPOF risk   |
| **Challenges**     | SPOF, storage overhead                    | Inconsistent data, complex integrations |
| **Best Use Cases** | Enterprise monitoring, compliance         | Microservices, edge environments        |

## **5. ELK Architecture**

**Data Flow:**
`Filebeat → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana`

### **Key Points**

* Logstash handles ingestion, filtering, and transformation.
* Elasticsearch indexes and stores the data.
* Kibana visualizes and alerts on insights.
* Filebeat acts as a lightweight agent to ship logs.

---

## **6. Setting Up ELK Stack**

### **6.1 Installation & Configuration**

* Install **Elasticsearch** for log storage.
* Configure **Logstash** pipelines.
* Install **Kibana** for visualization.
* Set up **Filebeat** to forward application logs.

### **6.2 Lab 1 – Setting up Elasticsearch**

**Objective:** Install and configure Elasticsearch for log storage.
**Duration:** 15 min
**Steps:**

1. Download Elasticsearch.
2. Configure `elasticsearch.yml`.
3. Start the Elasticsearch service.
4. Verify cluster health via REST API.

---

## **7. Logstash Pipelines**

Logstash pipelines define how logs are ingested, transformed, and sent to Elasticsearch.

### **Example Pipeline:**

```conf
input {
  file {
    path => "/var/log/app.log"
    start_position => "beginning"
  }
}
filter {
  json {
    source => "message"
  }
}
output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
    index => "app-logs"
  }
}
```

### **Lab 2 – Creating a Logstash Pipeline**

**Objective:** Configure Logstash to parse structured and unstructured logs.
**Duration:** 15 min

---

## **8. Kibana for Visualization & Monitoring**

Kibana provides real-time dashboards, alerts, and insights.

### **Steps to Create Dashboards**

1. Connect Kibana with Elasticsearch.
2. Define index patterns.
3. Create visualizations (bar, pie, heatmaps).
4. Build a centralized monitoring dashboard.

### **Lab 3 – Building Dashboards in Kibana**

**Objective:** Create dashboards for monitoring application performance.
**Duration:** 15 min
