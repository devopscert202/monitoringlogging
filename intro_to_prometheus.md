## Introduction to Metrics
Metrics are numerical data points collected over time to monitor the performance and health of infrastructure or applications. They are stored as time series data, each tied to a specific timestamp, and can include labels for additional context (e.g., hostname, application name).

**Key Uses of Metrics:**
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track system behavior under varying loads.
- **Alerting:** Trigger notifications when thresholds are breached.
- **Capacity Planning:** Identify trends to allocate resources efficiently.
- **Troubleshooting:** Pinpoint issues by analyzing historical data.

---

## Types of Metrics
Prometheus classifies metrics into four major types, each serving a unique purpose:

### 1. Counter Metrics
- **Purpose:** Track cumulative values that only increase (e.g., total HTTP requests).
- **Example:** `http_requests_total` for counting API calls.
- **Reset Behavior:** Resets to zero on restart.

### 2. Gauge Metrics
- **Purpose:** Measure current state values that can increase or decrease (e.g., memory usage).
- **Example:** `node_memory_used_bytes` to monitor memory consumption.

### 3. Histogram Metrics
- **Purpose:** Analyze distributions of values (e.g., request latencies).
- **Components:** Buckets for frequency counts, sum of observed values.
- **Example:** `http_request_duration_seconds` for tracking request times.

### 4. Summary Metrics
- **Purpose:** Provide quantile values (e.g., 95th percentile latency).
- **Example:** `rpc_duration_seconds` for RPC performance analysis.

## Prometheus Exporters
Exporters bridge non-Prometheus systems with Prometheus by collecting and exposing metrics in a compatible format.

**How Exporters Work:**
1. **Fetch:** Collect metrics from applications/systems.
2. **Transform:** Format metrics for Prometheus.
3. **Expose:** Serve metrics via HTTP endpoints (e.g., `/metrics`).
4. **Scrape:** Prometheus pulls metrics from exporters at configured intervals.

**Common Exporters:**
- **Node Exporter:** System-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk).
- **Apache Exporter:** Apache server metrics (requests, workers).
- **MySQL Exporter:** Database performance metrics.

**Advanced Configuration Options:**
- Customize scrape intervals (e.g., `scrape_interval: 30s`).
- Enable/disable specific metrics (e.g., `--collect.mysql.queries`).
- Relabel metrics for consistency.

---

## Relabeling in Prometheus
Relabeling manipulates metric labels before ingestion to normalize, filter, or route data.

**Relabeling Rules:**
- **Rename Labels:** Change `__name__` to `__metric_name__`.
- **Filter Metrics:** Keep only metrics matching `go_*`.
- **Drop Labels:** Exclude metrics with `job="node-exporter"`.
- **Modify Values:** Extract hostnames from `instance:port`.

**Use Cases:**
- Normalize label names across services.
- Filter out irrelevant metrics to reduce storage usage.

---

## Advanced Exporter Configurations
Tailor exporters to specific monitoring needs:

1. **Path Customization:**  
   `web.telemetry-path="/custom_metrics"` to serve metrics on a non-default path.
2. **Selective Collection:**  
   `--collect.mysql.userstats=true` to enable user-specific metrics.
3. **Dynamic Discovery:**  
   `--aws.ecs-cluster=my-cluster` for auto-detecting AWS ECS services.

---

## PromQL: Prometheus Query Language
PromQL enables powerful querying and analysis of time series data.

**Core Elements:**
- **Selectors:** Filter metrics by labels (e.g., `node_cpu_seconds_total{job="node"}`).
- **Matchers:** Refine queries with conditions (e.g., `instance=~"web-server-.*"`).
- **Operators:** Perform arithmetic (`+`, `-`), comparison (`>`, `<`), and logical operations (`and`, `or`).

**Functions:**
- **Instant Vector Functions:** `abs()`, `ceil()`.
- **Range Vector Functions:** `rate()`, `increase()`.
- **Aggregation Functions:** `sum()`, `avg()`.

**Example Query:**  
Calculate total available memory (free + cached) while ignoring instance labels:
```promql
sum(node_memory_MemFree_bytes + ignoring(instance) node_memory_Cached_bytes)
```

---

## Querying for Patterns and Anomalies
Identify trends and outliers for proactive monitoring:

1. **Detect Spikes:**  
   `topk(5, rate(network_bytes_received[5m]))`  
   Highlights the top 5 spikes in network traffic.

2. **Find Outliers:**  
   `avg(cpu_usage) + 3 * stddev(cpu_usage)`  
   Flags CPU usage exceeding 3 standard deviations.

3. **Missing Data:**  
   `absent(node_cpu_seconds_total)`  
   Alerts if no CPU data is received.

---

## Optimizing PromQL Queries
Improve performance for large datasets:

- **Use Range Vectors Wisely:** Limit ranges (e.g., `[1h]` vs `[7d]`).
- **Avoid Nested Aggregations:** Pre-filter data before aggregating.
- **Leverage Recording Rules:** Pre-compute frequent queries.

---

## Practical Use Cases
### Monitoring Apache Server Metrics
1. **Setup:** Install Apache Exporter and configure Prometheus to scrape its metrics.
2. **Key Metrics:**  
   - `apache_accesses_total` for request counts.  
   - `apache_workers` to monitor server load.  
3. **Query Example:**  
   `rate(apache_accesses_total[5m])` to track request rate.

### Node Exporter for System Health
- **Metric:** `node_memory_available_bytes` for memory monitoring.
- **Alert Rule:**  
  ```yaml
  - alert: HighMemoryUsage
    expr: node_memory_available_bytes / node_memory_total_bytes < 0.2
    for: 10m
  ```

## Conclusion
Prometheus provides a robust framework for monitoring modern infrastructure. By leveraging metrics, exporters, and PromQL, teams can gain deep insights into system performance, detect anomalies early, and ensure reliability. Start with basic queries, gradually incorporate advanced features like relabeling and aggregation, and optimize for scalability to build a comprehensive monitoring solution.

**Next Steps:**  
- Explore [Prometheus Documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/).  
- Experiment with custom exporters for niche use cases.  
- Integrate with Grafana for visualization.
